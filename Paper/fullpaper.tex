%1. State the problem
Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) provide a fast and robust decentralized means of key-value storage and retrieval and are typically used in Peer-to-Peer applications.
DHTs assign nodes a single identifier derived from the hash of their IP address and port, which results in a random overlay network.   
%2. Say why itâ€™s an interesting problem
A random overlay network is not explicitly optimized for certain metrics, such as latency, trust, energy, or hops on an overlay network.  It is often desirable to generate an overlay network that is optimized for one or more specific metrics.

%3. Say what your solution achieves
This paper presents VHash, a DHT protocol to construct an overlay optimized for such metrics. 
VHash exploits a fast and efficient Delaunay Triangulation heuristic in a geometric space. 
%4. Say what follows from your solution
We used VHash to generate an overlay with edges that minimize latency. 
While we focused on latency in this paper, VHash optimizes on any defined metrics.
This overlay outperformed an overlay generated by the Chord DHT protocol in terms of lookup time.
VHash provides a robust, scalable, and efficient distributed lookup service.
